BlackJack/Twenty-One

The main difference between this program and others that we have worked with so far is that I used an API to store the card objects so they would not need to be hard-coded into the actual program. This resulted in 3 different API calls (one to identify and store the deck in local memory, one to access the player cards, and a third to access the dealer cards).
	Shout out to the Deck of Cards API by Chase Roberts for the resource.

Next steps include creating modal boxes to signify winning and losing a hand.
